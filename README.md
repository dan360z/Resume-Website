# Rosie Odenkirk's Resume Website

## Welcome!

This is a resume website I have created for a made up developer called
Rosie Odenkirk to practice my html, css, and javascript skills.
I used the bootstrap css framework to make this website responsive to different screen sizes and
I have used the Google Maps API to show some locations of interest referenced in the website. 

## Technologies used:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* Google Maps API

## Testing
* I have tested this website extensively on a range devices to confirm that the site
is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Credits

* Developed by Daniel Field.
